<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi, I am a PhD student at the National University of Singapore. My research direction is trustworthy ML, which focuses on making machine learning models more transparent, robust, and fair. Currently, I am more interested in the explainability of neural networks. In other words, how to let a black box model provide supporting arguments about its decision-making process, or even further, train a model that is inherently transparent.

Prior to my PhD study, I finished my master‚Äôs at the Technical University of Munich, Germany, where my subject was Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence. I spent a great time doing research at CAMP (Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures & Augmented Reality). At CAMP, my research topic was about explainable AI and how to apply explanation methods on neural networks trained for medical purposes.

I did my bachelor‚Äôs study at RWTH Aachen University in Germany, majoring in Computer Engineering. My final year thesis and research at the senior stage is about hardware security. Specifically, how to do logic encryption on chips.

I am devoted to making ML more applicable in our everyday life, enabling ML models in safety-critical scenarios like medicine, finance, and civil. During my part time, I enjoy traveling in different places, especially relaxing beside sea, and exploring the other side of our planet through diving.

My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
