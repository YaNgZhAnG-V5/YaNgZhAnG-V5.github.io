<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi, I am a PhD student at the National University of Singapore, supervised by Professor [Kenji Kawaguchi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aLl3rYoAAAAJ&hl=en), driven by a passion for advancing the frontiers of artificial intelligence. My research explores the intersection of **efficiency**, **controllability**, and **explainability** in AI systems.

I started my research journey by delving into explainability‚Äîunpacking the ‚Äúblack box‚Äù of neural networks to reveal how they make decisions. Over time, my interests have grown broader. Today, I work on making AI not only more transparent but also smarter in its resource use and more controllable in its outputs, empowering us to shape these systems with precision and trust.

Prior to my PhD study, I finished my master‚Äôs at the Technical University of Munich, Germany, where my subject was Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence. I spent a great time doing research at CAMP (Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures & Augmented Reality) under the supervision of Professor [Nassir Navab](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=kzoVUPYAAAAJ&hl=en). At CAMP, my research topic was about explainable AI and how to apply explanation methods on neural networks trained for medical purposes.

I did my bachelor‚Äôs study at RWTH Aachen University in Germany, majoring in Computer Engineering. My final year thesis and research at the senior stage is about hardware security, supervised by Professor [Rainer Leupers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f57N-_oAAAAJ&hl=de). Specifically, the thesis is about how to do logic encryption on chips. I spend one year working on my thesis and as an RA later. 

My vision is to contribute to the advancement of AI as a transformative tool that enhances the quality of life and addresses meaningful challenges for humanity. I aspire to develop AI systems that are safe, reliable, and impactful, fostering solutions that promote progress and well-being on a global scale. During my part-time, I enjoy traveling to different places, especially relaxing beside the sea, and exploring the other side of our planet through diving.

My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
